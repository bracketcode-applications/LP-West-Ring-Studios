# [West Ring Landing Page - Resume](https://technicalmanager.io/)

The West Ring webpage was developed as a demo showcasing design ideas for a basic landing page that can be used in an online campaign. This demo specifically promotes a fake recording studio but the page structure can be customized and adopted for other types of businesses by swapping out image assets and content.

Development of West Ring landing page was based on the open-source [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) theme called [Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume/).

All other front-end development and content customization was done by webpage owner: [Albert Nera](https://www.technicalmanager.io).
